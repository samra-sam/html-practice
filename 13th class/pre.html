Richard Sandler
Marketing Hiring Manager
Carter Snack Company
3049 Arthur St.
Nashville, TN 37201
Dear Mr. Sandler,
I'm writing to express my interest in the position of marketing associate for Carter Snack Company. Your sales associate Nick Caudwell referred me to this opportunity. I believe that my five years of experience in food and drink marketing make me an excellent fit for this job opening.
In my current position at Fizz Soda Company, I spearheaded several successful campaigns for new drink products. My aptitude for market analysis helped me identify key demographics to target these marketing efforts. My most successful campaign of 2019:
• Doubled product sales over three months.
• Included a commercial video that went viral, getting more than 10 million views within a week.
• Resulted in more than 5,000 new Facebook likes within a month.
I believe that I could bring this level of success to Carter Snack Company and help your upcoming summer snack food campaigns reach a fresh audience. I see great potential in marketing to a younger demographic with your snack cakes and would love to discuss the possibilities with you.

Sincerely,
Janiqua Williams
