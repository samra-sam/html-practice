    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>The noradrenaline transporter (also known as norepinephrine transporter) (NET) has a critical role in terminating noradrenergic transmission by utilizing sodium and chloride gradients to drive the reuptake of noradrenaline (also known as norepinephrine) into presynaptic neurons1,2,3. It is a pharmacological target for various antidepressants </p>
